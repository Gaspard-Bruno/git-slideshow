# Git 101
## What is Git ?
- Git is a Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS), much like Mercurial or SVN.
  - Due to its distributed nature, it allows users to work offline and always keep a copy of a repo's history in their machine.****
- It is used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
- It is free and open source.

## How does it work ?
- Git basically tracks the history of file changes.
- Whenever we want to save a 'snapshot' of our code, we do a `commit` in a *repository*.
  - When we commit, git saves the changes that were applied to the original file. (not the actual file)
- All git operations are kept in your machine for a certain amount of time and are available through `git reflog`
  - *Due to this, it is very hard to permanently delete your work*

## What is remote ?
A remote is simply a pointer to a repo hosted by a provider (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket)

Notice how we seemingly have 4 master branches ?

We have in fact 3 different remotes and 1 local branch.

We can update/follow a remote's history by adding them to our local repo
`git remote set-url name https://github.com/organization/repo.git`

# Git Workflows
## Basic Workflow
![Basic git flow](https://buddy.works/blog/images/basic.png)
### Commands used
- `git init` / `git clone`
- `git add`
- `git commit -m "COMMIT MSG"`
- `git push origin BRANCH_NAME "COMMIT MSG"`
---
# Git Workflows
## Basic Workflow
The idea is simple: there is one central repository.
Each developer clones the repo, works locally on the code, makes a commit with changes, and push it to the central repository for other developers to pull and use in their work.
- The basic workflow can work fine if you're the only developer working on a project at a given time.
- Issues arise if 2 developers do changes to the code and push their code at the same time.
- Developers can align between them when each pushes the changes. Keeping the commits in a single branch.
- Enter feature branch workflow
---
# Git Workflows
## Feature Branch Workflow
![Feature branch workflow](https://buddy.works/blog/images/feature-branch.png)
### Commands used
- `git fetch origin`
- `git checkout -b "NEW BRANCH NAME"`
- `git checkout "BRANCH NAME"`
- `git merge "NEW BRANCH NAME"`
---
# Git Workflows
## Feature Branch Workflow
- For each new functionality, a new  branch should be created.
- This new branch will be where we develop and test a new feature.
- Once the feature is done, the branch is merged/rebased onto the master branch.
- This ensures the developers can work simutaneously in two different functionalities and merge them whenever without having to align timings.

## Rebase vs Merge
![Rebase vs Merge](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*pzT4KMiZDOFsMOKH-cJjfQ.png)
- `git rebase` solves the same problem as `git merge`. Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branchâ€”they just do it in very different ways.

| Merge                                  | Rebase                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1 Merge Commit                         | No extraneous commits               |
| Non-desctructive operation             | Re-writes commit history            |
| Commit history are in feature branches | Single line branch with all commits |
---
# Git Workflows
## Golden Rule of Rebasing
**There are two trade-offs for the pristine commit history the rebase workflow provides: safety and traceability.**
#### The golden rule of git rebase is to never use it on public branches.
- The rebase moves all of the commits in master onto the tip of feature.
- The problem is that this only happened in your repository.
- All of the other developers are still working with the original master.
- Since rebasing results in brand new commits, Git will think that your master branchâ€™s history has diverged from everybody elseâ€™s.
- You will need to **Force Push**
---
# Git Workflows
## Force Push
- If you try to push the rebased branch back to a remote repository, Git will prevent you from doing so because it conflicts with the remote branch. *only appliable if you did pushes in-between commits*
- But, you can force the push to go through like so:

`git push origin <BRANCH> -f` OR `git push origin <BRANCH> --force`
- This overwrites the remote branch to match the rebased one from your repository. So, be very careful to use this command only when you know exactly what youâ€™re doing.
- `git pull --rebase` does a pull but rewinds your local commits on top of the target branch

# Real Life Examples
Here we  have a branch which was recently merged into our repository ðŸ‘‡
![Rebase vs Merge](images/ss2.jpg)

- Follow `discounts` purple line to see where it initially forked from the main branch.
- When ready, the branch was rebased onto master and the local changes were merged onto the `discounts` branch.
  - This merge commit created a duplicate function which would later give us some trouble
  ![Rebase vs Merge](images/ss3.jpg)
- Finally then the rebased & merged branch would later be merged into master via pull request.
---
# Real Life Examples
#### What we could have been done ?
![solution](images/ss4.jpg)
Here are the steps I'd take to properly merge this branch onto `master`.
- I'd start by checking out the current branch and rebasing it on top of master
- I'd then open a pull request which once approved would create a merge commit.

We could also merge the branch into master which would work but would result in a messier history ðŸ‘‡
