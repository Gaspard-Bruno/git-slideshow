# Git Workflow Workshop
## How to open ?

Simply open presentation.html in a browser and you should have access to the slideshow ðŸ™‚

You can also do `yarn start` from your terminal and the index.html file will open in your browser.
## Adding new slides

You should start by reading [Remark's](https://github.com/gnab/remark/) Github repository in order to get started.

To add a new slide simply open to the `slideshow.md` file and add a hardline `---`. Remark will interpert it as a slide automatically
